CTFwithPods

1. My Framework 
Simple "Cocoa Touch Frameork" with a IB_DESIGNABLE "MyTextField" class. 

2. My App
A simple Swift application that use cocoapods to retrieve "MyFramework" framework content.
In Main.storyboard, i dragged an UIView with "MyTextField" as a custom class. The inspectable property is properly recognized but live rendering is not working. 
I get the same warning/error when MyApp is an full ObjC app.
